        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.
        </p><br>
        <br><p>It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into most of the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different spheres on Earth. Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the need to meet demands is increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil and noise pollution as a result of the universal dependence on technology.</p><br>
        <br><p>Nature has the power that removes many diseases from the body. Greenery reduces the stress of the mind and brings peace to the mind. So always keep in mind one thing next time if you have a lot of workloads and most of the time if you are surrounded by mental stress, then enjoy nature to calm your mind.</p>
